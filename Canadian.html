        <h2><marquee>What is Maple syrup?</marquee></h2>
        <p>Maple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, although it can also be made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks .</p>
        <h3><a href="#syrup"> Maple syrup Recipie</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <p>Step by step process</p>
            <li id="syrup">Step 1:</li>
                <p>>Firstly holes are drilled into the trunksof Maple trees.</p>
           <li>Step 2:</li>
                <p>>Buckets are placed near the holes so that all the liquid coming out of the tree is collected.</p>
           <li>Step 3:</li>
                <p>>The obtained syrup is not that think and mostly contains water. This sap is then boiled for a day or two so as to make the extract highly concentrated.</p>
            <li>Step 4:</li>
                <p>> This highly concentrated liquid is then stirred well until it cools down and the color changes to wine brown.</p>
            <li>Step 5:</li>
                <p>>This liquid after cooling down is mixed along with sugar and other preservatives so as to obtain the taste.</p>
            <li>Step 6:</li>
                <p>>This finally obtained Maple syrup is bottled and supplied to all the available stores for people to buy and consume.</p>
